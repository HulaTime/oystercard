 # Write a test that expects the card to remember the entry station after the touch in
 # Update the touch_in method to accept the entry station using a double
 # Update existing tests to pass a station to the touch_in method - you may need to declare your double in a let statement at the top of your describe block
 # Expose entry_station instance variable using an attribute reader
 # Make the card forget the entry station on touch out by setting it to nil
 # When your tests are all green, refactor to remove the in_journey variable. Rewrite the in_journey? method to infer its status based on whether or not there is an entry station
